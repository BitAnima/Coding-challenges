"""Space Week Day 2: Exoplanet Search
For the second day of Space Week, you are given a string where each character represents the luminosity reading of a star.
Determine if the readings have detected an exoplanet using the transit method.
The transit method is when a planet passes in front of a star, reducing its observed luminosity.

Luminosity readings only comprise of characters 0-9 and A-Z where each reading corresponds to the following numerical values:
Characters 0-9 correspond to luminosity levels 0-9.
Characters A-Z correspond to luminosity levels 10-35.
A star is considered to have an exoplanet if any single reading is less than or equal to 80% of the average of all readings.
For example, if the average luminosity of a star is 10, it would be considered to have a exoplanet if any single reading is 8 or less."""
